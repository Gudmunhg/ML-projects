# Project 2
### Classification and Regression, from linear and logisticregression to neural networks

### NN_py
Contains code for neural network with functions for classification.

### test_NN.py
Runs the neural network with data from the MNSIT database

### NN2_py
Contains code for neural network with functions for regression.

### test_NN2.py
Runs the nerual network with the Franke function

### structs.py
Contains dataclasses used by neural network

### helpers.py
Contains some of the functions and classes used by both neural networks

### log_lin_sgd.py
Contains the classes for logistic regression, linear regression and the stochastic gradient descent algorithm used on these. 

### digits.py
Runs logistic regression on the MNIST dataset.

### OLS_test.py
Runs linear regression on the Franke function, using SGD.
